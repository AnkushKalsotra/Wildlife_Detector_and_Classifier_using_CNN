# Wildlife_Detector_and_Classifier_using_CNN
This repository contains a CNN model for classifying images of animals into five categories: cow, dog, elephant, leopard, and tiger. The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 92 percent on a test dataset, making it highly effective for animal recognition tasks.

# Dataset
The model is trained on a carefully curated dataset of labeled images containing various instances of cows, elephants, leopards, and tigers. The dataset has been preprocessed and split into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure accurate evaluation of the model's performance.
